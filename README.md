This project pretends to plan a route of places to visit for a tourist that may seek different objectives.

The most simple way to achive this is implementing the **Orienterring Problem (OP)**, this model seeks to create a route that maximize a given arbitrary score 

# Orientation Problem with Time Intervals (OPTW)



The model known as the Orientation Problem (OP), is based on proposing a route in which user satisfaction is maximized on their visit to the places proposed by the system. These places will be classified as POIs (Points of Interest), each of which will have a reward or a qualitative score


- Create a repo for describing the GAMS implementation of the OP 
- Create a repo for describing the GAMS implementation of the OPTW (this one)
- Create a repo for the web app implementation of the of the OPTW with further development in the model I use
